    # text_as_bits, then move it into the required position in a byte using bit
    # shift (<<). When we OR this with the existing output byte, we know that
    # the bit in this position in the existing output byte is zero. Therefore
    # it becomes 1 if the value we obtained from text_as_bits was 1 and 0
    # otherwise. So, the first value from text_as_bits is the least significant
    # bit; j is zero so it does not move anywhere. Suppose it was 1, then the
    # results 0b000001. We set that bit in the current byte in text. Now,
    # suppose the next number in text_as_bits is 1; this is the next column in
    # the binary number. j is now 1, so we move this one place to the left,
    # resulting in 0b00000010. We OR that with the text byte (which is
    # currently 0b00000001 from the previous step). The result is
    # 0b00000011. In this way we gradually populate the byte in text with its 
    # individual bits (taken from the image file). We then move on to the next
    # byte and so on.
